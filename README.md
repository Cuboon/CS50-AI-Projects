# CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python – Project Portfolio

This repository contains my completed projects for **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. Each project focuses on a core AI concept, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation. All projects were implemented according to the course’s **implementation specifications and academic honesty policy**.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

### 1. Degrees (Search)

**Concepts:** Graphs, Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Built a program that determines the shortest path between two actors by connecting them through movies they have starred in together. This project demonstrates practical graph traversal and state-space search.

**Key skills:**

* Graph modeling
* BFS for shortest paths
* Efficient state tracking

---

### 2. Minesweeper (Knowledge Representation)

**Concepts:** Propositional logic, inference

Implemented an AI agent that plays Minesweeper by reasoning about the game board and making safe moves based on logical inference.

**Key skills:**

* Knowledge bases
* Logical sentences
* Inference from partial information

---

### 3. Knights (Logic)

**Concepts:** Propositional logic, model checking

Solved classic Knights and Knaves puzzles by encoding statements into propositional logic and determining which models satisfy all constraints.

**Key skills:**

* Logical modeling
* Symbolic reasoning
* Model evaluation

---

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe (Adversarial Search)

**Concepts:** Minimax algorithm

Created an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the minimax algorithm, guaranteeing the best possible outcome against any opponent.

**Key skills:**

* Adversarial search
* Game trees
* Optimal decision-making

---

### 5. Shopping (Machine Learning)

**Concepts:** Supervised learning, k-nearest neighbors

Trained a machine learning model to predict whether a user will generate revenue based on online shopping behavior.

**Key skills:**

* Data preprocessing
* k-NN classification
* Model evaluation (sensitivity & specificity)

---

### 6. Traffic (Neural Networks)

**Concepts:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Developed a neural network to classify traffic signs using image data, applying computer vision techniques and deep learning.

**Key skills:**

* Image preprocessing
* CNN architecture design
* Model training and evaluation

---

### 7. Parser (Natural Language Processing)

**Concepts:** Context-Free Grammars, parsing

Implemented a context-free grammar parser capable of parsing increasingly complex English sentences and extracting noun phrase chunks.

**Key skills:**

* Grammar design
* Syntactic parsing
* NLP preprocessing

---

### 8. Attention (Large Language Models)

**Concepts:** Transformers, attention mechanisms

Worked with a pre-trained BERT model to visualize attention heads and understand how transformer models attend to different tokens in a sentence.

**Key skills:**

* Transformer architectures
* Attention visualization
* Model interpretability

## 📌 Notes on Academic Honesty

* All projects were completed in accordance with CS50’s academic honesty policy.
* Starter code provided by the course was used where applicable.
* All modifications were implemented manually, limited to the functions specified in each project’s instructions.
* This repository is intended for **portfolio and learning purposes**, not for reuse by current students.
